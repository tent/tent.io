            <h1><a href="/blog/introducing-tent">Introducing Tent</a></h1><p>Tent is a new protocol for open, distributed social networking.</p>
            
            <p><em>What we believe</em> &ndash; <a href="/blog/the-tent-manifesto">The Tent Manifesto</a></p>
            
            <h3>What makes Tent different?</h3>
            
            <p>Tent is decentralized, not federated or centralized. Any Tent server can connect
            to any other Tent server. All features are available to any server as
            first-class citizens. Anyone can host their own Tent server. Tent servers can
            also be run as Tor hidden services to create a social darknet for at-risk
            organizers and activists. Anyone can write applications that connect to Tent in
            order to display or create user content.</p>
            
            <p>Relationships are between users, independent of their service providers, so
            users take their data and relationships with them when they change Tent service
            providers. Every user decides which other users can follow them and what
            information will be shared with each of their followers.</p>
            
            <h3>You are your memories and relationships</h3>
            
            <p>We use social networks to advertise our identities, communicate with friends,
            families, co-workers, customers, and brands. The content we create in the form
            of messages, uploaded media, and social graphs is not only valuable, it has come
            to define each of us. This information, our relationships and our data needs to
            be under our own control. When a user leaves a social service provider for any
            reason, that user should be able to take their relationships, not just a copy of
            their data, with them. Tent lets them.</p>
            
            <h3>Planning for the Future</h3>
            
            <p>Tent supports extensible formats for post types and profile information. As
            developers&#39; needs change they are free to create new open formats for data
            exchange. Tent is built on HTTPS, JSON and OAuth, each of which handles hundreds
            of millions of transactions online each day. We designed Tent to grow and adapt
            with its users.</p>
            
            <h3>The Tent Ecosystem</h3>
            
            <p>Tent is not specifying the economics of an ecosystem. There will be many options
            for users, from free to paid to self hosted, from ad-supported to
            advertising-free, with providers that serve different market segments and
            types of users. Since anyone can set up a Tent server or become a service
            provider, niche needs should quickly be met, based on demand.</p>
            
            <p>There are many spectrums of need:</p>
            
            <table class="table table-bordered">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>technically experienced</td>
                  <td>inexperienced</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>rich</td>
                  <td>poor</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>ad tolerant</td>
                  <td>ad intolerant</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>verified</td>
                  <td>pseudonyms</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>public</td>
                  <td>private</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>centralized</td>
                  <td>distributed</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            
            <p>The first Tent server implementation will be available as an open source
            repository very soon. A hosted version for users unwilling or unable to host
            their own will follow quickly.</p>
            
            <p>In the meantime, we encourage anyone with feedback or suggestions on the protocol or who is developing apps or services supporting Tent to add your services to the list in the GitHub repository via pull request. The
            same goes for post-types and profile info-types: a community site will launch
            soon, for now, use pull requests or reach out directly: <a href="mailto:info@tent.io">info@tent.io</a></p>
