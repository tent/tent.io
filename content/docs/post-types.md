## Protocol Posts

### Meta

`https://tent.io/types/meta/v0`

Every entity has a meta post, it is retrieved during
[discovery](/docs/servers-entities#discovery) by apps and servers. Some of the
`servers[].urls` members are Level 1 URI Templates as defined in [RFC
6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570).

When selecting a server to contact, sort the servers by `servers[].preference`,
preferring lower numbers over higher. If multiple servers have the same
preference, make a random selection. If server errors are encountered and there
is more than one server listed, another should be selected.

Changing the `entity` field triggers a change of the entity identifier that the
server represents. The previous entity must be added to the `previous_entities`
list in the same request.

All entities notified of this change must rewrite their posts with the updated
`entity` and add an `original_entity` parameter where applicable. This applies
to the post `entity` as well as entities used in mentions, version parents,
groups and permissions.

Modified meta posts are sent to all relationships and apps regardless of
subscriptions.

## Content Posts

### Status

`https://tent.io/types/status/v0`

Status is Tent's take on microblogging. Messages contain up to 256 characters of
text and optionally have a location.


#### Reply fragment

Status posts that are replies to another status post (mentioning one or more
posts) should set the fragment to
`reply`: `https://tent.io/types/status/v0#reply`

#### Markdown

Status posts support a limited variant of Markdown, known as "Tent-flavored
Markdown", in the `text`.

##### Inline Mention

`^[name](0)` is the syntax used to reference an entity. `name` is the display
text and `0` is the index of the mention in the `mentions` array.

```json
{
  // ...
  "mentions": [
    {
      "entity": "https://jesse.tent.is"
    },
    {
      "entity": "https://daniel.tent.is"
    }
  ],
  "content": {
    "text": "Hey ^[Jesse](0) and ^[Daniel](1)!"
  }
}
```

##### Span Elements

A limited set of the Markdown-style span element syntax is supported:

- [link](https://example.com) `[link](https://example.com)`
- _italic_ `_italic_`
- **bold** `*bold*`
- `code` `` `code` ``
- ~~strikethrough~~ `~strikethrough~`

Backslash is used to escape literals (`\*foobar`).

Line breaks are treated literally:

`Some text\n\nSome more text` becomes

```text
Some text

Some more text
```

(rendered with the empty line.)

`Some text\nSome more text` becomes

```text
Some text
Some more text
```

#### Counting Characters

The maximum length of the `text` is 256 Unicode characters (also known as code
points). Applications may want to normalize the text using [Unicode
Normalization Form C](http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/) to avoid surprising
users (for example `café` is 5 characters, while `café` is 4).
